## Question 1: Inference for the Poisson parameter $\lambda$:
(a) Given a general Gamma(a,b) prior, derive the posterior distribution of $\lambda$, given data $(x_1,\dots,x_n)$, followed by the posterior predictive distribution of $(z_1,\dots,z_m)$.  

(b) Assuming Gamma(a,b) priors for two Poisson parameters $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$, derive the posterior for $\phi = \lambda_1 / \lambda_2$. (Hint: use nuisance parameter $\mu = \lambda_2$).

(c) Derive the Jeffreys prior for $(\phi, \mu)$, and the corresponding marginal posterior for $\phi$. 

(d) Derive the reference prior for $(\phi, \mu)$, and the corresponding marginal posterior for $\phi$. 

(e) Based on (c), consider the posterior for $\phi$ based on uniform priors for $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$, and comment on when inference based on this posterior could be quite different from that based on the reference posterior from (e). Give a data example, in terms of resulting intervals. (Hint: the above posteriors are related to known pdfs, and by transformation may be simplified even further.).

## Question 2: Inference for variance components: 

(a) Use e.g. SAS (PROC VARCOMP) to perform a classical analysis of the data in Table 5.1.4 of Box & Tiao (1973), based on finding point estimates only.

(b)  Use WinBUGS for a Bayesian analysis of (a), and find reasonable point and interval estimates for $\sigma_1^2$ and $\sigma_2^2$. Include graphs, including one of the joint posterior. [6 marks] 

(c) Box & Tiao also studied a 3-component model (Table 5.3.1). 
    i. Derive central credible intervals, for the 3 individual components, based on Table 5.3.3.
    ii. Use WinBUGS to do the same, and include graphs.
    iii. While not going as far as Box & Tiaoâ€™s Figure 5.3.2, produce a graph of the joint posterior of $\sigma_2^2$ and $\sigma_3^2$, and one of $\sigma_2^2 / \sigma_3^2$


(d) Box, Hunter & Hunter (1976, Chapter 17.3) studied a pigment paste example with three components, focusing on point estimates only. Use WinBUGS again to perform a Bayesian analysis. Include graphs.
